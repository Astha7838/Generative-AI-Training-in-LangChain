    "# Assembling the Many Pieces of an LLM Application\n",

    "The key components you’ve learned about so far are essential building blocks of the LangChain framework. Which brings us to the critical question: How do you combine them effectively to build your LLM application?\n",

    "\n",
    "### Using the Runnable Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may have noticed, all the code examples used so far utilize a similar interface and the ```invoke()``` method to generate outputs from the model (or prompt template, or output parser). All components have the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a common interface with these methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```invoke```: transforms a single input into an output\n",
    "- ```batch```: efficiently transforms multiple inputs into multiple outputs\n",
    "- ```stream```: streams output from a single input as it’s produced\n",
    "\n",
    "There are built-in utilities for retries, fallbacks, schemas, and runtime configurability.\n",
    "In Python, each of the three methods have ```asyncio``` equivalents.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "As such, all components behave the same way, and the interface learned for one of them applies to all:"
